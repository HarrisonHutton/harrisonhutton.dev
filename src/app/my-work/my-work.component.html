                <p>
                    Built the frontend of a universal document search tool during my Summer '22 internship. I learned how to use <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and <strong>SCSS</strong> to design an inviting and functional UI and communicate with a Java Springboot backend. This tool allows employees to search for any document, new, old, or acquired by acquisition across all of M&T's CMS systems by using a taxonomy structure to hide the underlying complexity.

                    By cutting out the vendor fees of the systems that M&T was paying for, this app is saving M&T <strong>$4 million annually</strong>.

                Bytecode Interpreter
            </h2>
            <div class="portfolio__item--description">
                <p>
                    Built a bytecode interpreter in <strong>OCaml</strong> for my Programming Language's class project. I learned how to use a functional language to construct an abstract syntax tree for a given input file and then execute the file using a stack-based interpreter.

                <br>
                <p>
                    My goal throughout the project was to keep my code as modular as possible to isolate the individual working parts of the interpreter. I did this by separating the project into Types, Utilities, and Execution modules. This allowed me to quickly find and squash any bugs that appeared.

                    The toughest part of this project was implementing first-class functions and closures, but it did get done! Overall, this project was a great introduction to functional programming, pattern matching, and the power of recursion.
